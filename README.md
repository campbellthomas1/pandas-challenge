# pandas-challenge

In this challenge I was responsible for taking school data such as school type, total students, total school budget and spending per student. I was then correlating this information to Average math and reading scores, along with percent passing math, reading, and overall passing rates.

In this Analysis you will find a:
- District Summary
- School Summary
- Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing) and Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Math Scores by Grade, Reading Scores by Grade, and Scores by School Spending
- Scores by School Size, and Scores by School Type

It was found that charter schools perform better and have an overall passing rate higher than district schools, and that schools with lower amount of students perform better than school with higher amounts of students.

It is also important to note that schools with higher budgets did not necessarily have better test results. Schools who spent more actually performed worse than schools that didnt spend as much.

Another note is that there may be other factors besides school size, type, and budget, that play into the math, reading, and overall scores of the students.
